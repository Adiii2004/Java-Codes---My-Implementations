//octal = if you take 0 before number then your output must different lets see in below code

class Octal1 {

	public static void main (String[] args) {

		int x = 0111;
		/*Now in this case if we print x we get output 73 cause we join 0 before 111 then its octal number*/


		System.out.println(x);

	}

}
