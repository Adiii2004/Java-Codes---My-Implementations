Basic if else assignments
1. Write a program to check whether the given number is in the range of 1 to 1000 or
not.(take hardcoded values)
Input 1: num = 100;
Output: 100 is in the range 1 to 1000.
Input 2: num = 0;
Output: 0 is not in the range 1 to 1000.
Input 3: num = -11;
Output: -11 is not in the range 1 to 1000.
2. Write a program to check whether the given number is in the table of 13 or not.
Input 1: num =156;
Output: 156 is in the table of 13
Input 2: num =144;
Output: 144 is not in the table of 13
3.Write a program to check whether the given character is a vowel or consonant.(take hard
coded values)
Input 1: ‘a’
Output: a is vowel
Input 2: ‘D’
Output: D is consonant
4. A student has passed his 12 th standard exam he thinks he might get marks upto 85
percent. Suggest the better career field depending upon the marks assumption.(take
hardcoded values)
Input 1: percentage >85.00;
Output: Medical
Input 2: percentage <=85.00 and percentage >75.00;
Output: Engineering;
Input 1: percentage<=75.00 and percentage>=65.00;
Output: pharmacy or bachelor in science;
Y ou have to write the code using different values of percentage.
5. Write a program to check whether the given float value is divisible by 6 or not. (take
hardcoded values)
Input 1: floatNum = 120f;
Output: 120 is divisible by 6.
Input 2: floatNum = 89.96f;
Output: 89.96 is not divisible by 6.
6. Write a program to verify the age of the voter where the age should be positive. (that
means no negative values are allowed, take hardcoded values).
Input 1: 21
Output: V alid age for voting
Input 2: -31
Output: Invalid age
7. Calculate the profit or loss.
Write a program that takes cost price and selling price(take it hardcoded) and calculates its
profit or loss.
Input 1:
sellingPrice: 1200
costPrice: 1000
Output: Profit of 200
Input 2:
sellingPrice: 300
costPrice: 500
Output: loss of 200
Input 3:
sellingPrice: 900
costPrice: 900
Output: No profit no loss
8. Write a program to check whether the student passed with:
first class with distinction, first class, second class, pass and fail according to his percent
grades. (Y ou have to adjust range by your own for first class, second class and for pass)
Input 1: percent= 85.00
Output: Passed : first class with distinction
Input 2: percent=75.00
Output: Passed : first class with distinction
Input 3: percent=60.00
Output: Passed : first class
Input 4: percent=54.00
Output: Passed : second class
Input: percent=47
Output: Pass
9. Write a program in java to accept three numbers and check whether they are
pythagorean triplets or not.
Example:
a=3, b=4,c=5
If
a*a+b*b =c*c
Its pythagorean triplet
Else
Not a pythagorean triplet
Input:
a=3,b=4,c=5
Output : it is a pythagorean triplet
Input:
a=2,b=2,c=2
Output : it is not a pythagorean triplet
