/*
1.Write a program to perform basic arithmetic operations on two numbers.
Y our program should:
Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on the given numbers.
Display the results of each operation.
Example:
first number: 10
second number: 5
Addition: 10 + 5 = 15
Subtraction: 10 - 5 = 5
Multiplication: 10 * 5 = 50
Division: 10 / 5 = 2


2.Write a program to compare two numbers using relational operators.
Y our program should:
Compare whether the first number is greater than, less than, equal to, not equal
to,greater than or equal to, and less than or equal to the second number.
Display the comparison results.
Example:
first number: 7
second number: 5
7 > 5 : true
7 < 5 : false
7 == 5 : false
7 != 5 : true
7 >= 5 : true
7 <= 5 : false

3. Convert the given number in binary format where you have to first convert the
number in binary using pen paper and then check whether the given number is
the correct binary of the given number or not using code.
Ex. binary of 5 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1


4.Write a program to demonstrate logical operators.
Y our program should:
Perform logical AND, logical OR, and logical NOT operations on the given
boolean values.
Display the results of each operation.
Example:
	first boolean value (true/false): true
	second boolean value (true/false): false
	Logical AND: true && false = false
	Logical OR: true || false = true
	Logical NOT for the first value: !true = false
	Logical NOT for the second value: !false = true


5.Write a program to perform bitwise operations on two integers. Y our program
should:
Perform bitwise AND, bitwise OR, bitwise XOR, left shift, and right shift
operations on the given integers.
Display the results of each operation.
Example

 Enter the first integer: 5
 Enter the second integer: 3
 Bitwise AND: 5 & 3 = 1
 Bitwise OR: 5 | 3 = 7
 Bitwise XOR: 5 ^ 3 = 6
 Left shift: 5 << 1 = 10
 Right shift: 5 >> 1 = 2

6.Write a program to demonstrate various assignment operators.
Y our program should:
Initialize two variables with numeric values.
Use compound assignment operators like +=, -=, *=, /=, %= to modify the values
of the variables.
Display the updated values after each operation.
Example:
	Initial value of a: 10
	Initial value of b: 5
	After a += 3, a = 13
	After b -= 2, b = 3
	After a *= 2, a = 26
	After b /= 3, b = 1
	After a %= 5, a = 1


7.What is the output of given code:
Remember you have to first solve it in your own notebook and then type the code in your PCs.
Code
	class C2W{
		public static void main(String[] args) {
			int num = 100;
			num--;
			System.out.println(num<<1);
			num=num>>>1;
			num+=3;
			System.out.println(num);
		}
	}


8. What will be the output demonstrate in your notebook:
a.
		class LogicalCode{
		public static void main(String[] args){
		int x = 10;
		int y = 11;
		System.out.println((++x>=y)&&(x<++y));
		System.out.println(x);
		System.out.println(y);
	       }
	}


b.

	class BitwiseOperator{
	public static void main(String[] args){
		int x = 15;
		int y = 35;
		System.out.println(x & y);
		System.out.println(x | y);
		}
	}


9. What will be the output demonstrate in your notebook:
a.
class C2W{
public static void main(String[] args){

             System.out.println(25^6);
}
}
b.
class C2W{
public static void main(String[] args){
System.out.println(9>>>1);
}
}


10. What will be the output demonstrate in your notebook:
class C2W{
public static void main(String[] args){
int num1 = 8;
int num2 = 3;
int num3 = num1<<num2;
System.out.println(num3);
}
}


11. Write a program to differentiate between >> and << using your own
integer values and whatever your output is, that must be elaborated in your
notebook.


12. Write a program where you need to use the concepts you learned in
operators topic.


13. Write an output for the following.
Remember you have to first solve it in your own notebook and then
type the code in your PCs.
If x = 19
1. x++ + x++
2. ++x + x++ + ++x


14. Write an output for the following.
Remember you have to first solve it in your own notebook and then
type the code in your PCs.
If x = 14 and y = 22

1. ++x + y++
2. x++ + ++y + ++x + ++x
3. y++ + ++x + ++x
15. Write a real time example which uses 5 different operators.
If x = 0
1. ++x + ++x + ++x + ++x
2. x++ + x++ + x++ + x++
