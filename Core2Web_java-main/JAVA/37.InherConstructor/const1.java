 class Const1 {

}
/*
Whwn we read the byte code of this code we get

Compiled from "const1.java"
class Const1 {
  Const1();
    Code:
       0: aload_0
       1: invokespecial #1                  // Method java/lang/Object."<init>":()V
       4: return
}

here we can clearly see constructor is get created automatically at the name of class name "Const1()"
